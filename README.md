StellarNova is a web based MMO space trading game, based upon the a 2002 game <a href="https://blacknova.net/">Black Nova Traders</a> by Ron Harwood. It is a modern recreation which improves significantly upon UI making for a more fluid gameplay, and rebalances the game to enable different play modes for users.

## Tech Usage

StellarNova is a Express, MySQL, Angular and Node creation. It has a custom front end (<a href="https://github.com/Bogomip/rednova/tree/main/rednova">repo</a>) and backend (current repo).

This node/express backend has a pooled connection to the mysql database to create a fast and efficient database connection and keep the frontend moving as fast as possible for the player.
